    NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: <br />

    This is a copy of a conversation I had with a friend of mine. I thought it would be useful to share it here as well.<br />
    I'm sharing it as is, only translating my message from Turkish to English. <br />
    I'm not an expert by any means on these topics, and you will see a lot of simplifications and generalizations. <br />

We can say there are 3 main compilation types (that we usually talk about):

- *Ahead of time*: It's done before the code executes. (Like how C code is turned into Assembly mnemonics)
- *Just in time*: It's done during the code execution. (Like how Python interpreter processes *.py* scripts, or v8 handling JS code)
- *Transpilation*: Transforming a source code (language) to another one. (Like TypeScript to JavaScript)

These are all compilations but when we say compiled languages, we <i>usually</i> mean languages that are AOT compiled and produce native code as a result of compilation.
C compiles ahead of time and the compiler produces machine code for the target platform.

Example: *ANSI C* language is turned into *x86* machine code by *GCC* compiler.

And here is the thing you should know: *The language and its compilation/execution are different things.* You can go and execute C as JIT, but it's usually not the case because it's against the purpose of C.

JIT, is the process of turning the code into machine code of the system it's running on by a runtime environment / engine.
When you run a Python script, even if it's a "Hello World" code, a 60K lines of Python prelude / runtime is loaded into memory. Then the Python interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it.

**Java Runtime Engine (JRE)** and **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** (.NET's runtime) works similarly, but they don't do only JIT compilation.
For example, Java, first turns the code into another intermediate language called *Java ByteCode*. Then JRE turns this bytecode into the machine code of the system it runs on.
That's why Java is both a compiled (AOT) and an interpreted (JIT) language.

For C#, it's very similar. C# is turned into Common Intermediate Language by **Roslyn** (the name of C# compiler). This intermediate code is then executed by Common Language Runtime.

Transpilation is the process of turning a source code into another source code. It's usually used for turning a higher level language into a lower level one, but it doesn't have to be the case.
The most known example is TypeScript being transpiled into JavaScript. Here, the tool we use is called compiler (tsc), but the output is JavaScript, which is a higher level source code.
That's why we call these kind of <i>"special"</i> compilers *transpilers*.

Another example could be turning two high level languages into each other. It could be Python &lt;-&gt; JS for example.
This is also a compilation process, but the output is different.

Another example could be Babel. It turns new JS versions into the old ones. It does a JS -> JS transformation. This is also a compilation process.

TL;DR:
- There are 3 different main compilation types.
- We can group compilation types by the level of input and output codes.
- We can group compilation types by the time of compilation (before / during execution).
- Generally, we call languages (and their tools) that are AOT compiled and produce native machine code as a result of compilation "compiled languages", and languages (and their tools) that are JIT compiled and executed by a runtime environment "interpreted languages".
But there are more complicated systems like in Java and C# examples.
- The language and its compilation/execution are different things.
