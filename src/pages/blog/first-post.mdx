This is my first blog post. Welcome. 

I built this website using Astro, TailwindCSS, and MDX. I'm still trying a lot of things, so be prepared for changes.

You want to see something cool? Here's my current Tailwind config file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'primary': '#be185d',
        'midnight': '#1a1a1a',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
}
```

<em>IT DISPLAYS IT AS JAVASCRIPT CODE. HOW COOL IS THAT?</em>

And the text above should be in italics and color should be amber. So cool. It's <em>squirrel</em>-like cool.
I like <em>squirrels</em> btw.
