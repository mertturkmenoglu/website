You are reading this article in a webpage that is built with <em>Astro</em>. It's a <s class="text-accent line-through">new</s> <em>young</em> web framework, and it's kind of unique. If you look at their webpage,
they are calling their approach as <em>zero-JS frontend architecture</em>. It's focused on content and performance, and oh boy isn't it fast.

Probably one of the major features of Astro is the ability to combine multiple UI frameworks. You can develop components
with *React*, *Vue*, *Svelte*, etc. and use them in a single Astro page. You can develop one of your components with React, other one
with Vue, and make your page double bloated with JS. Pretty nice. Jokes aside, if you need to mostly produce static content but need
an interactive component that you can easily develop with a UI framework, than this approach is actually great. It gives you the flexibility.

Astro has a lot of integration options. TailwindCSS, Markdown, MDX, Rehype, CMS integrations, UI adapters, SSR adapters, Astro plugins, etc. Most of them also
have pretty easy setup. If you are using Yarn, you just run `yarn astro add tailwind` and it automagically sets up everything for you.

You have a file based router and create `.astro` files for your pages. You can utilize JSX and write components. You don't have reactivity, but you can have
variables, props, and use some good old JS. You can also use TypeScript. You write these inside two `---`s which is called *frontmatter*.

An example code from this website's source code (we are two parallel universes ahead right now, meta-meta programming):

```astro

const links = [
    { href: '/blog', label: 'Blog' },
    { href: 'https://github.com/mertturkmenoglu', label: 'GitHub' },
    { href: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/mert-turkmenoglu/', label: 'LinkedIn' },

<nav class="mt-4">
    <ul class="flex items-baseline gap-4 flex-wrap text-base sm:text-lg">
        {links.map((l) => (
            <li>
                <a
                    href={l.href}
                    class="font-bold text-accent transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out border border-accent px-4 py-1.5 rounded-lg hover:bg-accent hover:text-midnight"
                >
                    {l.label}
                </a>
            </li>
        ))}
    </ul>
</nav>
```

## Cool things I found about Astro:
* Oh boy it's fast. Static rendering ftw.
* *Bring your own framework* approach is pretty cool. You can statically render most of your content, and when you need an interactive component somewhere, you can just use a UI framework.
* Easy to learn, easy to set up. Documentation is pretty good.
* Really fast to build, deploy, and see the changes on your website.
* [Islands Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)
* A lot of integration options.

## Things I didn't like:
* I don't know if it's because of something I did stupidly, or it's a bug, using `<p>` tags broke my page. Like it completely broke it on
mobile. I had to use `<div>`s instead.
* Setting up MDX and TailwindCSS, and making them work together nicely was a bit of a challenge. I'm sure there are better ways to do it, but
my hot-wiring was a bit of a mess.

## Conclusion
I liked Astro. I think I'll continue to use it for my *mostly static content* websites. I like how it's *blazingly fast*.
